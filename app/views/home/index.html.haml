      %p
        I've lived in many different places, from Florida to New Zealand, and done many different things, including filmmaking, songwriting, motion graphics, and design. Mostly I enjoy creating things (including code!). I've recently started delving into Full-stack development and I can't get enough of it.  I enjoy working with Ruby on Rails and front-end technologies like Angular and Ember.js. Mostly I enjoy learning new stuff about web development and adding skills to my arsenal.

I've always been fascinated by the connection between science and art, the balance of technique and creative vision. The duality in those seemingly opposite spectrums, like yin and yang, come together in a beautiful way, complimenting each other. In any case, at some point I began to feel an interest in the art and science of coding. How far down the rabbit hole will I go? It's a long way down...
