  %h2 About me
  %p
    I've lived in many different places, from Florida to New Zealand, and done many different things, including filmmaking, songwriting, motion graphics, and design. Mostly I enjoy creating things (including code!). I've recently started delving into Full-stack development and I can't get enough of it. I enjoy working with Ruby on Rails and front-end technologies like Angular and Ember.js. Mostly I enjoy learning new stuff about web development and adding skills to my arsenal.
