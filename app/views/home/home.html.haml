%h2#about About me
%p
  I've lived in many different places, from Florida to New Zealand, and done many different things, including filmmaking, songwriting, motion graphics, and design. Mostly I'm passionate about creating things. I enjoy working with Ruby on Rails and front-end technologies like Angular and Ember.js. I like learning new things and adding fresh skills to my arsenal.
